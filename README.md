jQuery App-Folders
===========

Use jQuery to create iOS-like App Folders on any website. They can contain any content and be styled in any way.

• Works great on mobiles  
• Responsive design  
• Fully styleable (it's easy!)  
• Well-documented  
• Very easy to use  
• Can contain any content (images, text, video, complex layouts)  
• Opened Folder can be linked to from other pages  
• Configurable position changes for nth folder  


===========

How to implement:

1. Include the following script within a <script> tag.  

	$(function() {
		$('.app-folders-container').appFolders();
	});
							
2. Then, include the following elements:  

	<!--This is what you call in the function above-->
	<div class="app-folders-container"> 
		
		<!-- jaf-row 1 (You can have as many rows as you like) -->
	    <div class="jaf-row jaf-container">
	    
	      <!--You can have as many folders as you like-->
	      <!--Folder's ID must match Class of the item that it opens-->
	      <div class="folder" id="uno">
	        
	        <!--Anything wrapped by this link can open the content on click.-->
	        <a href="#">
	          <p>Folder 1</p>
	        </a>
	      </div><!--End Folder-->
	    </div><!--End Row-->
	    
	    
	    <!--Now, include the content that you want to show for each Folder-->
	
	    <!-- CLASS must equal the ID of the item that calls it.-->
	    <div class="folderContent uno">
	      <div class="jaf-container">
	      
	        <!--Add whatever HTML you want in this area-->
	        <p>Content for folder one.</p>
	      
	      </div>
	    </div><!-- End folderContent uno-->
	    
	</div><!--End app-folders-container-->

		// Opacity of non-selected items
		opacity: .2,
		
		// Adjust the margin-top for the folder area based on row selected?
		marginTopAdjust: true,
		// If margin-top-adjust is "true", the natural margin-top for the area
		marginTopBase: 0,
		// If margin-top-adjust is "true", the absolute value of the increment of margin-top per row
		marginTopIncrement: 50,
		
		// Time (in ms) for transitions
		animationSpeed: 200,
		
		// Use URL rewriting?
